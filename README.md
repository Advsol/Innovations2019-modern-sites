## Website and theme installation instructions
To install the demo website and theme follow these steps:
1. Download the contents of this repository.
2. Next you will need to zip up the contents of the "Latte" folder, which contains all theme assets.
3. Under **RiSE > Tagging > Tagged list formats** import and publish the **TaggedListFormat.xml** file.
4. Under **RiSE > Document system** select the "images" folder then import the **Images.xml** file.
5. Under **RiSE > Theme Builder > Website layouts** import the **Coffee_Layout.xml** file.
6. Under **RiSE > Theme Builder > Website templates** import and publish the **Coffee_Template.xml** file.
7. Under **RiSE > Theme Builder > Themes** select **New > Theme**. Name the theme "Latte", be sure the box is checked indicating it is responsive, then select the .zip folder you created in step 2. Save and publish the theme.
8. Go to **RiSE > Site Builder > Manage websites** and import and publish the **EcoCauses_Website.xml** file.
9. Go to **RiSE > Page Builder > Manage content**. If the content was correctly imported go ahead and publish it. If not, you can delete the content that was imported then import and publish the **EcoCauses_Content.xml** file.
10. (Optional) If you would like to see the "Follow us" navigation items in the footer you will need to add a custom navigation area. Go to **RiSE > Site Builder > Manage websites** and select your EcoCauses website. Select the **Navigation areas** tab and click the pencil icon on the tab. Add a new navigation area called "Footer2". Please note that the **Navigation Pane Code** will need to be 16 in order for the navigation to appear. If you already have a navigation area with the code 16 then you may need to update the "Follow us" navigaiton items to use the new navigation area instead.

At this point you will have a working website with the new theme.
